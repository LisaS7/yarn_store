# Brief

### Shop Inventory

Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's inventory. This is not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop workers.

#### MVP

- The inventory should track individual products, including a name, description, stock quantity, buying cost, and selling price.
- The inventory should track manufacturers, including a name and any other appropriate details.
- The shop can sell anything you like, but you should be able to create and edit manufacturers and products separately.
  - This might mean that it makes more sense for a car shop to track makes and models of cars. Or a bookstore might sell books by author, or by publisher, and not by manufacturer. You are free to name classes and tables as appropriate to your project.
- Show an inventory page, listing all the details for all the products in stock in a single view.
- As well as showing stock quantity as a number, the app should visually highlight "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user.

#### Inspired by

eBay, Amazon (back end only), Magento

#### Possible Extensions

- Calculate the markup on items in the store, and display it in the inventory
- Filter the inventory list by manufacturer. For example, provide an option to view all books in stock by a certain author.
- Categorise your items. Books might be categorised by genre (crime, horror, romance...) and cars might be categorised by type (SUV, coup√©, hatchback...). Provide an option to filter the inventory list by these categories.
- Mark manufacturers as active/deactivated. Deactivated manufacturers will not appear when creating new products.
